Validating with just HTML :

PRESENCE VALIDATION 
1) Check to see that something isn't empty. It's required.

 <input id="username" name="username" type="text" placeholder="username" required> 
 or
  <input id="username" name="username" type="text" placeholder="username" required="true">
  
  a) note : this does not work in every browser. It will work in Chrome. But it is up to the browser. 
  
 Other types of Validation : 
 
 DATA TYPE or FORM of DATA 
 <label for="username">Email:</label>
  <input id="username" name="username" type="email" placeholder="email" required>
  
  1) by changing type="email" you now validate by data type
