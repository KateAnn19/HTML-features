- <form> tag to submit all info at once
- action (where the form sends data to)(if an action isn't specified then the form will go to the exact same place that you are) <form action="http://
wikipedia.org" method="GET"> of course we're not sending data to wikipedia. we will send it to our own server/database/back-end
- method (what HTTP method (get/post) - if a method is not specified then it will be a GET request
action- the URL to send form data to
method- the type of HTTP request
- input type
- placeholder
- div and span
- p tag
- input type = submit (1 type of button)
- <button> tag (another type of button) 
- name attribute (creates query string - key/value pairs seperated by ampersands)
- labels make things accessible to screen readers for visually impaired folks (p tags and h tags could be used but it would not be 
accessbile to screen readers)
-two ways to do a label tag   
<form> <label>Username<input type="text" placeholder="username"></label> </form> (inline)  or
<form> <label for="username">Username</label> <input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username"> </form>
-for in the label and id in the input   - need to match 

-simple validations  (forcing rules onto a data structure)
-cannot leave email blank, password must be between 5-10 characters (see HTML5 for updated code on this)
- required (you can say required="true" but unnecessary because the fact that it's there means it's true (this does not work in every
browser. It works in Chrome but not every browser).  Presence Validation - makes sure something is there (required) 
-data type type of data required in a certain format    just changing type to email in input tag does this

Other Ways to get user input 

1) check boxes / radio buttons

<input type="checkbox">
allows users to select and unselect

<input type="radio">
only one choice like choosing gender

when wanting to force only one answer first create a <form> </form> tag and put everything in
<input type="radio>
<input type="radio>

then add labels 
<label for="dogs">
<input name="petChoice" id="dogs" type="radio>
<label for="cats">
<input name="petChoice" id="cats" type="radio>

then add name="sameName"
<input name="petChoice" id="dogs" type="radio>
<label for="cats">
<input name="petChoice" id="cats" type="radio>

then add value=
<input name="petChoice" id="dogs" type="radio value="dogs">
<label for="cats">
<input name="petChoice" id="cats" type="radio value="cats">


2) select tag

create drop down menus 
on select we need a name="day" 
option
for seperate drop down menus create new open and closing select tags
on option tag change the value to equal something that will be displayed in the browser if you do not want answer to be seen

3) textarea tag
create inputs that are more than 1 line

<textarea rows="10" cols="10"></textarea>

also want to give a name 
<textarea name="message" rows="15" cols="30"></textarea>



<input type="submit">  
or
<button>Submit</submit>   if button is the last in a form then it will submit the form
