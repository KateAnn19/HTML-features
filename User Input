- <form> tag to submit all info at once
- action (where the form sends data to)(if an action isn't specified then the form will go to the exact same place that you are) <form action="http://
wikipedia.org" method="GET"> of course we're not sending data to wikipedia. we will send it to our own server/database/back-end
- method (what HTTP method (get/post) - if a method is not specified then it will be a GET request
action- the URL to send form data to
method- the type of HTTP request
- input type
- placeholder
- div and span
- p tag
- input type = submit (1 type of button)
- <button> tag (another type of button) 
- name attribute (creates query string - key/value pairs seperated by ampersands)
- labels make things accessible to screen readers for visually impaired folks (p tags and h tags could be used but it would not be 
accessbile to screen readers)
-two ways to do a label tag   
<form> <label>Username<input type="text" placeholder="username"></label> </form> (inline)  or
<form> <label for="username">Username</label> <input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username"> </form>
-for in the label and id in the input   - need to match 

-simple validations  (forcing rules onto a data structure)
-cannot leave email blank, password must be between 5-10 characters (see HTML5 for updated code on this)
- required (you can say required="true" but unnecessary because the fact that it's there means it's true (this does not work in every
browser. It works in Chrome but not every browser).  Presence Validation - makes sure something is there (required) 
-data type type of data required in a certain format    just changing type to email in input tag does this

Other Ways to get user input 

1) radio buttons 
2) select tag
3) textarea tag


<input type="radio">
only one choice like choosing gender
<input type="checkbox">
allows users to select and unselect
